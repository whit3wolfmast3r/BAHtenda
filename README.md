# 🔴 Unhinged Button Tracker

Every office has one. Ours is named **Cian "MoneyShot" Murphy**.

This lightweight, judgment-free app exists for one reason: to **tally up every time someone says something absolutely unhinged** during the workday. Whether it's a deranged idea, an unfiltered opinion, or yet another *"you won't believe what I did this weekend"*, this app is here to silently hit the red button and keep score.

## 🚀 Features

- 🟥 A simple, satisfying **red button** to press when the chaos strikes
- 📊 Real-time tally of total **unhinged moments**
- 🧍‍♂️ Separate counter for **Cian "MoneyShot" Murphy**, since, let’s face it, most of them are his
- 🧠 No analytics, no database, just vibes (and maybe a little therapy)

## 🧩 Use Cases

- Your team is on a Zoom call and someone suggests an NFT for dogs
- Cian says, *"What if we did a body shot off the client to close the deal?"*
- Someone threatens to run a campaign on Truth Social unironically
- Your creative director uses the phrase *“fungible charisma”*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS/JS or your preferred frontend poison
- Local storage for tally tracking (or connect a DB if you're bold)
- Optional: Add sound effects, Slack integrations, or a flashing red light

## 📉 Analytics

Stats show that ~83% of all button presses stem from statements made by Cian. We don’t make the rules—we just count the chaos.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This app is for entertainment purposes only. If your HR department asks, just say it’s a mindfulness tracker.
